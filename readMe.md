# Saturated Reverse Polish Notation (SRPN) Calculator

RPN is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. 

SRPN is a reverse polish notation calculator with the extra feature that all arithmetic is saturated i.e. when it reaches the maximum value that can be stored in a variable, it stays at the maximum rather than wrapping around.
